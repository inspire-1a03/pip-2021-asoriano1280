#### Summary

Even though an area such as Thunderbay, where it is more accessible to nature and parks, Toronto consist of many parks and trails within the city that residents can attend to. As well, Toronto being a greater populated area than Thunderbay, can explain why visitation between the areas can differ yet be so similar.

#### Summary

Interesting to see how other areas in a different province have trends similar to Ontario. Visitation rate to parks is higher in Red Deer, similar to a Surburb, and Calgary coming close to it as well. Rate of visitation in Alberta is on a higher scale which may be due to the increase in outdoor locations.

Provinces such as Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia that consisted of many cases and restrictions with COVID experienced the least amount of travel to work compared to other areas in Canada. Seen in the figure, Canada had similar rates of travelling to work until the first lockdown.
