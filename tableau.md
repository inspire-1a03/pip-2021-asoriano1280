# Exercise 3: Advanced visualization using Tableau


## 1. Mapping regional vaccination rates
> Q1: What is the current state of vaccinations among provinces and territories?

#### Summary

Territories are in a better state based on vaccinations per 100 people compared to the provinces. Among the provinces, vaccinations are similar but have slight differences in rates based on vaccination roll out and population.

## 2. Changes in travel to retail and recreation destinations for provinces/territories
> Q2: How has travel to recreation and retail locations changed over time between regions of Canada?  

<!-- Paste your embed code for your figure below-->

#### Summary

During the initial lockdown throughout Canada, it is visible that there was a dip in travel to recreation and retail locations. As the pandemic continued each province differed in cases and restrictions, that shows why provinces such as Prince Edward Island where there were very few cases had an increase in visits again compared to provinces such as Ontario where it was less accessible.

## 3. Changes in travel to parks for Ontario counties/municipalities
> Q3: How has travel to parks changed over time in Ontario's counties/municipalities?  

<!-- Paste your embed code for your figure below-->

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/asoriano-visits-parks/Sheet1?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '650' height = '650' scrolling='no'></iframe>

#### Summary

Based on the season and weather conditions, it is observed that visits to the parks across the counties and municipalities that appear above have all experienced an increase. A major finding was that York, an area that is a suburb, had the most change in visitation to parks. 

## 4. Reflection 
> What are your initial thoughts about using Tableau vs. Google Sheets? What might be the advantages of each? 
> What inferences can you make from the Mobility data that you explored and visualized? 
> What new questions would you like to ask of the data? 
> How might you use these two datasets together to perform new analyses? 

Using Tableau and Google Sheets have both been such an informative experience to learn. Each software requiring its own steps and processes to create figures is what I found the most interesting. Iâ€™m not too much of a person who knows a lot about technology and how to use it, and so it was great to apply myself and see my creation sort of come to life. An advantage for Tableau would be how the data is already formed for you so there is not much to do there besides placing it in the sheets. Advantages for Google Sheets would be how easy I find it to customize the figure to your liking as well as understand how some of the data is formulated. The mobility data that I have explored definitely corresponds to patterns that are occurring throughout the pandemic. For example, people will go outside, most likely to a park because that is what is the most readily available place that is safe at the time. In addition, weather also plays a huge role in that rate since visits are seen to drop once it starts to get cold. Some new questions I would like to ask this data would be about how many people in each Territory and Province are vaccinated or how a decrease in park visits during the winter season affect Canadians mental health. I could use these two datasets together to perform new analyses by looking at specific areas and seeing any other underlying trends from there. For example, some of the data in Google Sheets looks at all of Canada and I can use information from Tableau to look at specific Territories, Provinces, and even municipalities within then compare them with one another. It would be interesting to compare a region in Ontario to a region in Prince Edwards Island.
